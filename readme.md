# Point it out! (pointitout.js)

A tiny library to point it out DOM elements by procedurally generated and 
absolutely positioned SVG elements

## Want to contribute? You should know:

- Specs folder
    - Should contain an .spec.ts file for each core feature.
        - Create a new .spec.ts file if you add a new feature.

- No releases and npm package at the moment
    - Coming soon!

- No CI at the moment.
    - A CI/CD pipeline to generate the npm package would be appreciated.
